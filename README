# MiniUTXO-Blockchain

🔥 A lightweight and modular Python implementation of a mini UTXO-based blockchain and virtual wallet system.

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the core mechanics behind blockchain-based digital currency.
It implements a minimal UTXO ledger, allowing secure value transfers using signed transactions,
public-key verification, and block-based confirmation.

## 🧠 What It Includes
- Secure digital signatures (private/public keys)
- Signed transactions with validation
- Block creation and confirmation
- A minimal blockchain ledger
- Wallets that track and update UTXO balances
- Clean, modular architecture for easy extension

## 🏗 Project Structure
- **bank.py** – Manages the blockchain and validates transactions
- **block.py** – Represents a block of confirmed transactions
- **transaction.py** – Creates & verifies signed transfers
- **wallet.py** – Generates keys, signs transactions, tracks UTXOs
- **utils.py** – Cryptographic helper functions

## 🎯 Purpose
A compact, easy-to-read blockchain engine designed to illustrate how cryptocurrency systems
(such as Bitcoin’s UTXO model) work under the hood — without unnecessary complexity.
