# 🟣 MiniUTXO-Blockchain
*A modular and lightweight Python implementation of a mini UTXO-based blockchain.*

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements a **miniature blockchain engine** focused on the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model — the same conceptual foundation used by Bitcoin.
It includes digital signature flows, UTXO selection, block creation, verification logic, and a clean separation between Wallet, Transaction, Block, and Bank (Ledger).

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how value moves securely in a blockchain system, how ownership is proven, and how transactions are validated using cryptography.

## 🧠 Architecture
Below is the core structure of the project:

```
MiniUTXO-Blockchain/

├── ex1/
│   ├── bank.py         # Maintains UTXO ledger and block history
│   ├── block.py        # Represents a block containing transactions
│   ├── transaction.py  # Defines transaction structure + signatures
│   ├── wallet.py       # Generates keys, manages balance, creates signed transactions
│   ├── utils.py        # Crypto helpers (hashing, signing, verifying)
│   └── __init__.py     # Clean module export
│
├── tests/              # Organized test suite

└── .gitignore

## 🔐 Cryptographic Flow
Here's how a value transfer works in this mini-blockchain:

1. **Wallet creates a key pair** (private/public).
2. A **transaction is constructed** referencing a previous UTXO.
3. The transaction is **digitally signed** using the sender’s private key.
4. The Bank verifies:
   - Signature authenticity
   - Ownership of the referenced UTXO
   - UTXO not yet spent
5. If valid — the transaction is added to the next block.
6. UTXO set is updated:
   - Old UTXO consumed
   - New UTXO created for the receiver

This mirrors the fundamental system used in real cryptocurrencies.

## 📦 Features Included

### 🔹 Core Blockchain Logic
- UTXO-based transaction model
- Signature validation using public keys
- Prevention of double-spending
- Block structure and confirmation flow
- Simple append-only ledger simulation

### 🔹 Wallet Functionality
- Keypair generation
- Balance tracking using UTXO scan
- Secure transaction creation
- Automatic selection of spendable UTXOs

### 🔹 Clean & Modular Code
The project follows a separation-of-concerns design, allowing each component to remain testable and easy to extend.

## 📘 Example: Creating a Transaction

```python
from ex1.wallet import Wallet
from ex1.bank import Bank

# Initialize bank & wallets
bank = Bank()
alice = Wallet()
bob = Wallet()

# Bank gives Alice an initial coin
bank.genesis(alice.public_key)

# Alice creates a signed transaction to Bob
tx = alice.create_transaction(bob.public_key)

# Bank processes the transaction and adds it to a block
bank.add_block([tx])
```

---

## 🧪 Testing
A dedicated `tests/` directory is included, containing:

- Public ledger tests
- UTXO flow tests
- Signature security tests

All tests rely on Python's `pytest` framework.

## 📝 Requirements
Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⭐ Future Improvements
Planned upgrades that could extend the project:

- Merkle tree support
- Proof-of-Work mock engine
- Multi-input transactions
- API interface for submitting transactions
- Persistent storage of blocks
